& 	AND Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
|	OR Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
^	XOR Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
~	NOT	Inverts all the bits
<<	Zero fill left shift  Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
>>	Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
