#Addition + and subtraction - has the same precedence, and therefor we evaluate the expression from left to right:

print(5 + 4 - 7 + 3)

print(10 + 5)

print((6 + 3) - (6 + 3))

#Multiplication * has higher precedence than addition +, and therefor multiplications are evaluated before additions:
print(100 + 5 * 3)

x = 5
y = 3

print(x >= y)
